# Simulation Results of 'NonGaussianities in homogenenous freely evolving granular gases'

This repository contains the data files for the simulation results exposed in the paper 'A. Meg√≠as and A. Santos, NonGaussianities in homogenenous freely evolving granular gases,' to be published.

The folders contains the following data:

- Mathematica: Notebook to reproduce the theoretical results exposed in the paper.
- HCS: Data from DSMC and EDMD simulations in the Homogeneous Cooling State (HCS) for the Sonine approximation (SA) relevant quantities: $\theta=T_r/T_t$, and the first nontrivial cumualants $a_{20}$, $a_{02}$, and $a_{11}$; and for the exponents of the high-velocity tails of the HCS velocity distribution function: $B_c$, $B_w$, and $B_{cw}$ for hard disks (HD).
- cumulants: Simulation data from DSMC and EDMD for the time evolution of the SA relevant quantities for HD.
- histograms: Histograms from simulation data both from DSMC and EDMD algorithms in the HCS for HD.
