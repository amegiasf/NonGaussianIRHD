# Simulation Results of 'NonGaussianities in homogenenous freely evolving granular gases'

This repository contains the data files for the simulation results exposed in the paper 'A. Meg√≠as and A. Santos, NonGaussianities in homogenenous freely evolving granular gases,' to be published.

The folders contains the following data:

- Mathematica: Notebook to reproduce the theoretical results exposed in the paper.
- HCS: Data from DSMC and EDMD simulations for the Sonine approximation (SA) relevant quantities, and for the exponents for hard disks.
- cumualants: Simulation data from DSMC and EDMD for the time evoltion of the $\theta=T_r/T_t$, and the first nontrivial cumualants $a_{20}$,
